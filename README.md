# CheatCatalyst
CheatCatalyst is a Lua-based cheat script designed to reverse-engineer games and provide players with an unfair advantage. It is not an executor, but rather a tool that can be used to gain access to features not normally available to players.

## Features
CheatCatalyst includes a variety of features designed to make gameplay easier, including:

* **Bypassed exploit scripts:** The CheatCatalyst script includes links to several popular exploit scripts, including Dex and Engospy, which are designed to help players bypass game security measures and gain access to features normally unavailable to them.

* **Remote spy:** The remote spy feature allows players to monitor other players' game activity, including their chat messages and other in-game actions.

* **Third-party scripts:** CheatCatalyst includes links to several popular third-party scripts, such as Infinite Yield, that provide additional functionality to players.

## Installation
To use CheatCatalyst, players must first download the script and run it using a Lua executor. This can be done using software such as Synapse X or Krnl.

Once the script is running, players can access its various features through an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

## Usage
To use CheatCatalyst, players should:

1. Download the CheatCatalyst script from the GitHub repository.
2. Run the script using a Lua executor.
3. Use the CheatCatalyst GUI to access the various features.

Please note that using CheatCatalyst to cheat in games may be a violation of the game's terms of service and could result in account bans or other penalties. Use at your own risk.
